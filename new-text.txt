I will never forget the commitment to reconciliation and peace that I encountered in Hiroshima in 2016. The memory of August 6, 1945, must never fade; it allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change. https://t.co/A9lKu0c0PR

We have to treat voting as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy. So make sure you are registered to vote. Request a mail-in ballot early and send it back early. Then get your family and friends to do it, too. Every vote counts. https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T

We've got to fight harder to protect the right to vote. It’s one of the most powerful tools we have––and we can start by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Once we pass that, we should continue marching forward to make it even better.
